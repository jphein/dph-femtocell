# Bring-up: from a boxed MicroCell to a call

**Scope: written from a DPH-151 (ip.access train `563.21.8`) brought up against an Osmocom
core.** The DPH-153 route is reported to work the same way with different attribute values.
**The DPH-154 is unproven** — see [`HARDWARE.md`](HARDWARE.md).

Read [`TRAPS.md`](TRAPS.md) first. Most of the time this takes is spent on the traps, not
on the steps.

---

## ⛔ Before you plug anything in

**Isolate the unit.** On first boot the firmware does: DHCP → DNS lookups for its
operator's management hostnames → IPsec to a security gateway → TR-069 to a management
server → retry forever. Those endpoints are dead, so nothing will answer — but **the DNS
queries and IPsec attempts leave your network**. Put the unit on an isolated VLAN or
segment with no route to the internet before you power it on. This is configuration, not
a purchase.

**Do not enable the radio yet.** Everything up to Phase 5 is passive. The PLMN question
(below) is a hard gate: settle it before anything transmits.

---

## Phase 0 — Identify the unit

Record, from the label: model, FCC ID, part number, hardware revision, MAC, and **the PSU
voltage**. Do not guess the PSU.

Then decide which model you have and read the matching section of
[`HARDWARE.md`](HARDWARE.md) — the three are not interchangeable, and **firmware from one
will not load on another** (the image loader gates on PCB number and rejects a mismatch).

## Phase 1 — Find it on the network, and knock

Power on with Ethernet and find the DHCP lease. Then:

```sh
nmap -sT -p 22,23,80,443,8080,8090,20000 <ip>
nmap -sU -p 14677 <ip>
```

- **TCP 22** — SSH is expected. See [`ACCESS.md`](ACCESS.md); the SSH daemon is ancient and
  a modern client will refuse it three times in a row for three different reasons.
- **TCP 8090** — the ip.access **DMI** management console. If this is open and
  unauthenticated you may be able to do everything below without a root shell.
  **Try this first: it decides which of two worlds you are in.**
- **UDP 14677** — the fail0verflow `wizard` backdoor (unauthenticated root command
  execution). Present on the 151 and reported still present on the 153. **A negative on a
  154 is a result worth writing down**, not a failure.

## Phase 2 — Serial console (if the network route does not open one)

Locate the UART pads. On the 151, fail0verflow used header **JP1** at **56700 baud** (try
57600 as well). **Use a 3.3 V-only adapter.**

Capture the whole boot log to a file. It is the single richest artefact you will get: it
names the boot order, the configuration mechanism, the inter-processor link, and exactly
what fails when the operator's infrastructure is unreachable.

## Phase 3 — Get a management channel

See [`ACCESS.md`](ACCESS.md). You need to be able to issue **DMI** get/set/action commands
on the radio processor. Everything below is expressed in those terms.

> ⚠️ **Use the transport that answers, not the one that looks right.** On our DPH-151 the
> `-u 8090` telnet front end **accepts input and never answers a `get`** — bare LF, CRLF
> and Telnet linemode negotiation all return a banner and a `dmi>` prompt and no result —
> while the local one-shot client returns answers to the identical commands. The commands
> are byte-identical; only the transport differs. **Verify your transport with a known-good
> read before trusting a silence.**

**Positive control for the transport:** read an attribute you know exists, e.g.
`get hnbGwAddress`. If that comes back, a later miss means the attribute name is wrong. If
it does not, your transport is dead and every subsequent "not found" is meaningless.

## Phase 4 — Point it at your core

Four settings. Read every one back afterwards — **the caller's log line that it sent a
command is not evidence the callee accepted it.**

```
set ipsecEnable FALSE
set apNtpServerInfo ("<NTP-IP>")     # the OPERATIONAL NTP attribute
set defaultNtpServer ("<NTP-IP>")    # the FACTORY-DEFAULT tier -- a DIFFERENT tier, not a duplicate
set hnbGwAddress "<HNBGW-IP>"        # your osmo-hnbgw, read-write, max length 260

get ipsecEnable
get hnbGwAddress
```
⚠️ **`get apNtpServerInfo` is deliberately not in that list** — see the NTP note below. On this
hardware it errors, and an erroring read is not a failed setting.

> ### ⭐ NTP is not a nicety — it gates the whole thing
> Without working NTP the device **does not even attempt the HNB-GW connection**. And there
> are two NTP attributes at different tiers: the factory-default one is applied after a
> reset and **is not necessarily the value in force**. Writing only the factory tier fails
> **silently** and looks exactly like the HNB-GW step being broken.
> **Set both.**
>
> ⚠️ **But do not verify by reading the operational tier back** — on our DPH-151 that attribute was
> **rejected in every form tried**, so the read tells you nothing either way. **Verify
> behaviourally instead: does the gateway connection get attempted at all?** That is the thing NTP
> gates, and unlike the attribute it is observable.
>
> ⚠️ If your unit has no route to the internet, an NTP address that resolves publicly will
> resolve fine and **never sync**. Point it at an NTP server it can actually reach.

> ### ⭐⭐ Those two NTP writes are one setting at two TIERS — and reading back the one you wrote proves nothing
> They are not belt-and-braces. Several settings here exist at four parallel tiers and **the
> prefix is the tier**; the model, and the caveat that precedence between the tiers is inferred
> rather than traced in code, is in [`CONFIG.md`](CONFIG.md#the-four-tier-value-model). **`defaultNtpServer` above is one of
> those prefixed names on a DPH-151** — which is how we know the structure is not specific to
> the sibling hardware.
>
> ⛔ **What matters at this step is that it defeats the "read it back" rule the rest of this
> guide runs on.** A `get` of the tier you just wrote returns your value, cheerfully, and says
> **nothing** about what the device is doing. A night went into exactly that: writing the
> `local*` tier while the **operational** tier drove behaviour. *Every readback passed.*
> ⇒ ⭐ **Read back the bare name. That is the tier that acts.**

> ⚠️ **Reboot survival is a separate question with a measured surprise in it:** an *empty*
> `lkg*` tier is not neutral, and a correctly-set value vanished at a reboot because of it —
> detail in [`CONFIG.md`](CONFIG.md#the-four-tier-value-model). ⇒ **Reboot the unit before you believe your bring-up.**
> [Phase 7](#phase-7--surviving-a-power-cut) is where that lands.

## Phase 5 — Give the radio parameters, then unlock, then connect

> ### ⛔ STOP. This is the step that puts a transmitter on licensed spectrum.
> Everything before this point was passive. From here the cell radiates.
>
> **Go and read the “Before you transmit: spectrum” section of the [README](../README.md)
> now, if you have not.** Band 2 and Band 5 are refarmed and in active use; empty of the old
> technology is not the same as vacant. There is a clean route (an experimental licence) and a
> pragmatic one (minimum power, minimum antenna, one room) — and **you cannot have house-wide
> coverage and RF containment at the same time.**
>
> **And settle the PLMN before this step, not after.** A unit that ran on a carrier's network
> still carries that carrier's MCC/MNC. See [`CONFIG.md`](CONFIG.md), and verify it **on the
> air** — trap 15 in [`TRAPS.md`](TRAPS.md) is a store that reads back correctly while the
> broadcast never changes.

> ### 🔴 The step everyone misses: set the selection METHOD, then the list
> With no usable radio parameters the select action **acknowledges and selects nothing** — you
> get `uarfcnDownlink = -1`, `scramblingCode = -1`, `operationalState = DISABLED`, and an HNBAP
> association **with no radio**. The core shows the cell registering. No handset can attach.
> The symptom is "the core says it's up and the phones say no service", and it will send you
> to debug the core for a day.
>
> ⚠️ **Populating `rfParamsCandidateList` is only half of it — and an earlier revision of this
> page said it was all of it.** `AUTO` reads **network-listen scan results**, not your list;
> `CONFIGURED` reads the list. **A unit in `AUTO` that has never scanned selects nothing no
> matter what the list contains**, which is indistinguishable from the write not landing.
> ⇒ **Set the method first, and read it back before you unlock.** Full detail — including a
> transmit-power attribute whose *meaning* changes with the method — in
> [`CONFIG.md`](CONFIG.md#rfparamscandidatelist--the-one-nobody-sets-and-the-cell-dies-without-it).

```
set cellParameterSelectionMethod CELL_PARAMETER_SELECTION_METHOD_CONFIGURED
set rfParamsCandidateList ({<uarfcn>, <scrambling-code>, 1})
get cellParameterSelectionMethod     # read it back BEFORE the unlock action
action <selectCellParams>
action <unlock>
action establishPermanentHnbGwConnection
```

Substitute a UARFCN legal for you, in a band the unit supports and your handsets support.
The action IDs are numeric and firmware-specific; find them in your unit's action table
rather than copying ours. Two anchors that helped us cross-check: the **lock** and
**unlock** actions are adjacent numeric inverses, and
`establishPermanentHnbGwConnection` is present **by name** in the binary.

⚠️ **Issue one command per invocation.** A single bad attribute aborts an entire DMI batch,
so a perfectly valid attribute sitting in a batch with a bad one reads as *"does not
exist"*.

⚠️ **Put a timeout on every call.** A `get` can hang indefinitely even when it is the only
client on the box; without a bound, one hung call stalls everything after it. A killed call
must not abort the run — continue to the next command.

⛔ **Never kill the management daemon** to "clean up". On this firmware it owns the TR-069
session, the data model *and* the DMI action path — killing it destroys the channel you are
working over, and on our unit it caused a reboot.

## Phase 6 — Confirm, without lying to yourself

On the core:

```sh
printf 'enable\nshow hnb\n' | nc -q1 127.0.0.1 4261
```

> ### ⛔ `show hnb` alone is NOT sufficient. It fails in **both** directions.
> - It reports the **context**, not the device: ours counted uptime for **three minutes**
>   (and in another run nearly ten) on a cell that had been **unplugged from the wall**.
> - Roughly **one read in seven** returns the **welcome banner only** — a few hundred bytes
>   of confident-looking text with no answer in it. A classifier based on byte count scores
>   every one of those as a good read.
>
> ✅ **Require the literal token `HNB connected`, never a size.** Then confirm, one line
> below in the *same* output, that the peer's SCTP state is **ACTIVE** and not INACTIVE.
> Retry on a token miss — a single clean read of that port means nothing.

**A registration is not a working cell.** Accept it only when all three hold at once:

```
the core accepts an HNB-REGISTER-REQ after this boot
operationalState = ENABLED
uarfcnDownlink > 0
```

Then attach a handset and check for a subscriber, with a control on the read — a zero from
a failed read looks exactly like a real zero.

## Phase 7 — Surviving a power cut

Whatever you script, put it somewhere durable. On our DPH-151 the only writable store that
survives a power cycle is a **jffs2 partition mounted at `/var/ipaccess`**; anything under
`/var/run` is tmpfs and clears at boot (which is what you want for a lock file, and exactly
what you do not want for your scripts).

⚠️ **The device's own configuration files live under that same path, in a *bank* it can
regenerate without asking you.** Two traps apply directly to anything you write there, and both
are model-dependent:
[trap 1](TRAPS.md#1-iuh_enable--two-config-files-two-parsers-one-silent-failure) — one key, two
files, two different parsers, one silent failure — and
[trap 2](TRAPS.md#2-which-config-bank-is-live-differs-per-model--and-guessing-kills-the-cell),
where **which bank is live differs per model**, and guessing kills the cell. **Read the live
bank; never assume it.**

> ### ⛔ Do not call a cold boot failed before **T+20 minutes**
> Measured across ten cold boots on our unit:
> ```
> ~5 min   the core reaps the stale SCTP association from the previous life
> ~11 min  the NAT state clears and the AP's SCTP INIT finally gets through
> ~16 min  the cell registers; handsets follow within about a minute
> ```
> The second term is remarkably stable; **the first one is what varies** (we saw 3m09s and
> 5m22s). If a boot runs long, that is the term that moved. Quote both, never just the
> total. One 2006-era handset was consistently last and could not be hurried — 96 s to
> 609 s after the others.

Two things worth building in, both learned the hard way:

- **Log that your recovery script ran, and when.** A self-healing fix that acts silently
  destroys the evidence for whether it was needed — "the setting persisted" and "my script
  fixed it" produce identical readings. A pre-NTP 1970 timestamp in the log is also proof a
  run was automatic and not someone at a keyboard.
- **Refuse to run if a healthy association already exists**, with an override flag. Re-running
  a bring-up against a working cell tears it down.

## Phase 8 — A call

At this point the cell is an ordinary HNB on your core. Everything else — subscribers,
voice, SMS, packet data — is core-network work and belongs to the Osmocom documentation,
not to this repo.
